## 📖 Project Description

This project was created in **one week** as part of the 
<a href="https://briefweek.fr" target="_blank">Brief of the Week</a> challenge.  

The goal was to design and develop an **immersive landing page** for the fictional band **Phoenix**. 

I worked in collaboration with [*Gaurav Mali*](https://github.com/HaribolGM), who was in charge of the **art direction and visual identity**.  
On my side, I focused on **development** and learned to integrate 3D elements with **Three.js**, while also experimenting with smooth animations using **GSAP** and **Lenis**.  

This project illustrates the creativity and speed of execution highlighted by the BOTW.
